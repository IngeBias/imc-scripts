# Vyatta Adapter

This is a first cut of the Vyatta adapter for IMC

IT HAS ONLY HAD VERY LIMITED TESTING!!!!

Right now it has only been tested with CLI backup. 

Set your file transfer type to SFTP, to force it to use CLI.

SCP, FTP and TFTP should all be supported in future, but they have not
yet been tested AT ALL!

To use, copy the adapter-index.xml and Vyatta files/directories to (IMC)/server/conf/adapters/Brocade
