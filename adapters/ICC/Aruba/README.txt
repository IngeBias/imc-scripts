This is a first cut at a VERY ROUGH adapter for Aruba controller backup.

Lots of tidyup to do - it has not been tested AT ALL. I wrote this "blind" without any test gear

It needs cleanup, and it needs a lot of error checking.

At a minimum, it needs to have the sysOIDs restricted.

I would like to implement other methods of backup too - it seems these devices may support a "show run" type of backup.
Don't know if SCP/SFTP is possible, but CLI + FTP should be
