The Aruba, Brocade, F5 Hewlett-Packard and Nortel networks adapter customisations have been removed

As of IMC 7.2, HP has either added those adapters, or fixed the problems with them.

You should install the most current version + patch.

If you can't install the latest patch, then install the patch on a test system, and manually copy those adapters across
